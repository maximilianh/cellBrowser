# Contributor Code of Conduct

Please be nice, respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences and acknowledge that every piece of code has a history that is 
not free of time/money/personal constraints.

What sometimes comes up is the coding style and libraries used. The project does not use every popular Javascript framework. This has the disadvantage that some things are slower to implement at first, but has the advantage that we potentially can get contributions from programmers who are not yet on the most recent frameworks and also that when something breaks, we do not have to dig through the implicit behavior that is part of the framework. We hope that contributors are not put off by this. We do appreciate any ideas on how to improve the UI system, possibly by adding a UI framework in a light-weight way.

This is a relatively small software project and all contributors have all been extremely nice, 
which is why this Code of Conduct is very short.
